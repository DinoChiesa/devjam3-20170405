# Verifying 3rd Party JWT

*Duration : 20 mins*

*Persona : API Team/Security*

# Use case

You would like to build an API Proxy that will verify a JWT generated by a 3rd party. For example, you would like to Implement [RFC 7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523), which describes how to exchange a JWT for an opaque OAuth token. 

# Background

[JWT is described in IETF RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). It is a standardized approach to signing a payload, represented as JSON. Any application can produce or verify the signature on a signed JWT. 

JWT is being used by many systems, including Google APIs, Azure Active Directory, Ping, Salesforce, and many others. 

# How can Apigee Edge help?

You can easily configure Apigee Edge to verify a JWT produced by any third party, whether the signing algorithm is HS-256 (shared secret) or RS-256 (public/private key).

Because Apigee Edge can verify JWT, you can construct your API Proxies to authorize inbound requests based on federated identity. 


# Pre-requisites

1. You have a login to Apigee Edge, and your organization includes the devjam oauth2-ac API proxy.  Your lab proctor can help with that, or you can deploy your own. See [the proxy bundle](../../../Resources/oauth2-oidc).

# Instructions

If you have completed the 2-legged OAuth exercise, then, you do not need
to create a different API Proxy, or API Product, or App. If you **have not** completed that
exercise, you must create those three things now. Do so, like this: 

## First, Create the API Proxy 

1. First, download [this zip file](./code/apiproxy_xxx_oauth_protected.zip) to your local machine, by clicking the link, and then clicking "Download". Then return here.

2. Go to [https://apigee.com/edge](https://apigee.com/edge) and be sure you are logged in.

3. Select **Develop → API Proxies** in the side navigation menu

   ![image alt text](./media/Develop-Proxies.gif)

4. Click **+ Proxy**. The Build a Proxy wizard is invoked.

   ![](./media/Plus-New-Proxy.gif)

5. Select **Proxy bundle**. Click on **Next**, and then choose the zip file that you just downloaded.

   ![image alt text](./media/New-Proxy-Import-Bundle-Next.gif)

2. Specify the name for the new proxy, using your initials..., and click **Next**

   ![image alt text](./media/use-your-initials-click-next.png)

2. Then click **Build**

   ![image alt text](./media/click-build.png)

2. Once the API proxy has been built, **click** the link to view your proxy in the proxy editor. 

2. You should see the proxy **Overview** screen. 

2. Click the **Develop** tab.

   ![image alt text](./media/click-the-develop-tab.png)

   This shows you the contents of the API Proxy definition. This is just a pass-through proxy. There are no logic steps on this proxy, yet. 

3. Select the Proxy name and Update the display name with your initials.

   ![image alt text](./media/update-display-name.gif)

4. Select the Proxy Endpoint and update the basepath, similarly.

   ![image alt text](./media/update-basepath.gif)

2. Select **PreFlow** from the sidebar under **Proxy Endpoints** section.

   ![image alt text](./media/select-preflow.png)

2. Click on **+Step**

   ![image alt text](./media/add-a-step.png)

2. In the resulting dialog, scroll down select **OAuth v2.0** from the Security section then click the **Add** button.

   ![image alt text](./media/select-oauth2.gif)

2. Click on the policy and in the code editor, paste the code given below:

   ```
   <OAuthV2 name="OAuth-v20-1">
      <DisplayName>OAuth v2.0-1</DisplayName>
      <ExternalAuthorization>false</ExternalAuthorization>
      <Operation>VerifyAccessToken</Operation>
      <GenerateResponse enabled="true"/>
   </OAuthV2>
   ```

   It should look like this: 

   ![image alt text](./media/should-look-like-this.png)

2. Because we want Apigee to not pass the token to the backend API, let's remove the Authorization header. To do so, again click on **+Step**.

2. In the dialog, select **Assign Message** policy from the Mediation section then click the **Add** button.

   ![image alt text](./media/add-another-step-assign-message.gif)

2. Click on the policy and in the code editor, paste the code give below

   ```
   <AssignMessage name="Assign-Message-1">
     <DisplayName>Assign Message-1</DisplayName>
     <Remove>
        <Headers>
           <Header name="Authorization"/>
        </Headers>
     </Remove>
     <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
     <AssignTo createNew="false" transport="http" type="request"/>
   </AssignMessage>
   ```

   It should look like this:

   ![image alt text](./media/screenshot-20170403-175612.png)


2. Click the blue **Save** button to save the proxy.

2. *Congratulations!*...You’ve now successfully created an API in Apigee Edge that is protected with OAuth 2.0.

2. Use the Deployment dropdown to deploy it on the **test** environment.

## Second, Create the API Product

Once again, if you have completed the exercise for the OAuth 2-legged
flow, you do not have to complete this set of steps. 

1. In the Apigee UI, select **Publish → API Products** from the side navigation menu

   ![image alt text](./media/select-publish-apiproducts.gif)

2. Click **+API Product**

   ![image alt text](./media/click-plus-apiproduct.png)

3. Populate the following fields

    * Section: Product Details

        * Name: **{your_initials}**_oauth_product

        * Environment: test

        * Access: Public

        * Allowed OAuth Scopes: A,B,C

    * Section: Resources

        * Section: API Proxies

            * Click the **+API Proxy** button
            
              ![image alt text](./media/add-a-proxy-to-a-product.png)

            * Select the API Proxy you just created.

4. Click the blue **Save** button on the bottom right corner of the page, to save the API Product.
  
  There is now a new, consumable unit of APIs available to external (consuming) developers. 


## Third, Create the App

Again, you need to do this only if you have not created an App for the
2-legged OAuth exercise.

1. Click **Publish → Apps** in the side navigation

   ![image alt text](./media/select-publish-apps.gif)

2. Click **+App**

   ![image alt text](./media/click-plus-apps.png)

3. Populate the following fields

    * Name: **{your_initials}**-oauth-app

    * Developer: (choose any available developer)

    * Product: Click **+Product** to add your API Product to this App.

   ![image alt text](./media/select-api-product.gif)

4. In the lower right corner, click the blue **Save** button.


## Get the client credentials

Now, obtain the consumer key and secret for the app, and encode them. 

1. In the apps list, select the app that you just created

2. Click on the show button under Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.

3. Copy the values and store them somewhere safe.


## Obtain a token

Now, we'll go through the 3-legged flow to obtain a token that
authenticates both the client app and the end user of the app.

1. In the Apigee UI, Navigate to Develop...Proxies...

2. Select the API Proxy called oauth2-oidc (or similar).

3. From the Proxy overview panel, copy the URL for your OAuth API proxy. 

   ![image alt text](./media/copy-the-oidc-oauth-url.png)

   The url should end with oauth2, and oidc should appear in the path, prior.  

4. Click the Trace tab. Start a Trace session on the OAuth proxy. Later, you
   can view this session to see the message exchanges. 

5. Open a new browser tab to the [link builder](http://dinochiesa.github.io/openid-connect/link-builder2.html)

   This is a web form that helps you build a link for the OpenID Connect initiation.

6. Fill out the form with these values:

   * Edge org: **{your organization name}**
   * Edge env: **{your environment name}**, (probably `test`)
   * basepath: the basepath from the copied OIDC OAuth URL, above.
   * client_id: the client id you saved, previously
   * client_secret: the client secret you saved, previously
   * nonce: a nonce, a unique value per request
   * state: anything you like
   * callback URI: `https://dinochiesa.github.io/openid-connect/callback-handler.html`
   * response type: Select `id_token`
   * scope: Select `openid` `profile` and `email`

   When you have done this, the form should look something like this:

   ![image alt text](./media/OIDC_Link_Builder2.png)

   You will notice as you fill out the form, a hyperlink appears at the bottom of the form.
   This link is constructed according to the rules for OpenID Connect.
   This web form is just a helper for a developer. An actual user would never see
   this experience. The URL generation would be embedded in the client app. 
   
7. When you have completed the form, right click the URL to open that location in a new tab.
   You should see a login form, that looks like this:

   ![image alt text](./media/screenshot-20170404-115414.png)

   This login screen is actually being served by an external website. In the normal
   case, the login-and-consent user experience is somethiing the API provider
   exposes. It will have branding that identifies the API provider, and will be a
   common experience that will apply to multiple, perhaps many, third party apps.
   Every time a user authorizes a new third-party app, they'll go through the same
   user login-and-consent experience.

8. Authenticate.  The username / password of dino@apigee.com / IloveAPIs should work.

9. You should then see a consent form. It notes the scopes that the app is asking for.
   Agree to give consent.

9. When that happens the web page will show a JWT, generated by Apigee Edge.
   It will look like this:

   ![image alt text](./media/callback-handler_html.png)

   This JWT identifies both the user and the client application.
   The client_id is contained in the aud property, and the user information
   is contained in other properties in the JWT.

9. You can now go back to the Apigee UI and examine the Trace session.
   Please note: if others are performing the same exercise, their transactions
   may be interspersed with yours in the same trace session. 


9. In a real app, the JWT can then be stored and used until it expires. 


# For Extra Credit

1. Go back to the Link Builder page and try different combinations of response_type and scope.


# For Discussion and Consideration

1. When used in production, should a JWT use HS256 algorithm or RS256?  Why? 

3. Why would you want to design a service to use opaque OAuth tokens, versus JWT? Why would OpenID Connect allow the generation of both at the same time? 


# Summary

In this lab you learned how Apigee Edge can be used to generate JWT via OpenID Connect.
