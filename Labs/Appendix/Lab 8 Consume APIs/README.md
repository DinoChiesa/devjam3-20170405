# API Publishing : Consume APIs 

*Duration : 20 mins*

*Persona : Developer*

# Use case

As an App Developer you would like to learn about APIs exposed by the API Team using API Documentation. Register in API Program to get access to the APIs exposed by the API Team.

# How can Apigee Edge help?

Apigee Edge has out of the box lightweight Developer Portal which allows API Team to publish API Documentation & as an App Developer you can self register onto API Platform. Once logged in, you can create Apps to get API Keys using which you can access APIs securely.

In this lab, we will see how to register as an App Developer, navigate through API documentation, create app in the Developer Portal to access API keys, test the APIs using the keys we got from Developer Portal.

# Pre-requisites

Secure APIs with API Keys, Publishing API Documentation lab exercises. If not, jump back to *API Security - Securing APIs with API Keys* lab.

# Instructions

* Go to [https://apigee.com/edge](https://apigee.com/edge) and log in. This is the Edge management UI. 

* Select **Publish → Portals** in the side navigation menu.

* Let’s **create** a Developer App.

Typically, developers who want to consume APIs go to developer portal and register to use them. When registering, the developer gets to select which of API products he or she wishes to use. For example, some products may be offered for free, while others require payment depending on a service plan. Upon completion, this registration step produces an Edge entity called a **developer app**. A developer app includes the products the developer selected and a set of API keys that the developer will be required to use to access the APIs that are associated with those products. 

* To Create an App, Click on **Email Address** & then **My Apps** in top menu bar.

* Let’s add API Product to app before we user API keys, Click on **Manage Products** to add API Product to the App that we have created.

# Lab Video

If you like to learn by watching, here is a short video on consuming APIs using Apigee Developer Portal [https://youtu.be/nCJwlVF6waw](https://youtu.be/nCJwlVF6waw)

# Earn Extra-points

Now that you have Registered in Developer Portal, Created App, Read API Documentation, Explore more by making an API call using keys generated above.

# Quiz

1. When you create an APP, What are the different keys associated with it ?

2. Is it possible to create different Apps with same App Name ?

3. Is it possible to associate multiple API Products with same App ?

# Summary

That completes this hands-on lesson. In this simple lab you learned how to self register as a Developer to access APIs, Create Apps, Access API Keys, Navigate through API Documentation.
